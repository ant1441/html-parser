#![allow(dead_code)]

//! A code point is a Unicode code point and is represented as "U+" followed by four-to-six [ASCII upper hex digits](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-upper-hex-digit),
//! in the range U+0000 to U+10FFFF, inclusive.
//! A code pointâ€™s value is its underlying number.
//!
//! A code point may be followed by its name, by its rendered form between parentheses when it is not U+0028 or U+0029, or by both.
//! Documents using the Infra Standard are encouraged to follow code points by their name when they cannot be rendered or are U+0028 or U+0029;
//! otherwise, follow them by their rendered form between parentheses, for legibility.
//!
//! A code pointâ€™s name is defined in the Unicode Standard and represented in ASCII uppercase. [UNICODE]
//!
//! > The code point rendered as ðŸ¤” is represented as U+1F914.
//! >
//! > When referring to that code point, we might say "U+1F914 (ðŸ¤”)", to provide extra context. Documents are allowed to use "U+1F914 THINKING FACE (ðŸ¤”)" as well, though this is somewhat verbose.
//!
//! > Code points that are difficult to render unambigiously, such as U+000A, can be referred to as "U+000A LF".
//! > U+0029 can be referred to as "U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS", because even though it renders, this avoids unmatched parentheses.
//!
//! Code points are sometimes referred to as characters and in certain contexts are prefixed with "0x" rather than "U+".
